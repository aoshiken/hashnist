### INTRODUCTION

This project provides a server for the SHA-256 hashes of the National Software Reference Library from the NIST.

The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) is designed to collect software from various sources and incorporate file profiles computed from this software into a Reference Data Set (RDS) of information.

The server is a TCP server named `hashchecker` and written in C/C++, a Python client is located inside the folder `python` and a web backend with installation instructions is located under the `web` folder.

For improving speed and memory footprint `hashchecker` requires an input file with all the SHA256 hashes in binary format, the companion tool named `binaryze` can generate that file, see the INSTALLATION section below.


### INSTALLATION

First, we build the `hashchecker` server and the `binaryze` tool:
```
$ ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make
```

Get the SHA1-to-SHA256 file from NIST:
```
$ curl https://s3.amazonaws.com/docs.nsrl.nist.gov/morealgs/blockhash/rds241-sha256.zip -o rds241-sha256.zip
```

Convert the NIST SHA256 data to a file with all of the SHA256 hashes ordered in
just one line with no blanks in between:
```
$ cut -f 2 rds241-sha256.txt | LC_ALL=C sort -u | tr --delete '\n' > sha256-ordered.txt
```

Now you can convert the file from the previous step into a binary file using
 the 'binaryzer' utility:
```
$ binaryze -i sha256-ordered.txt -o sha256-ordered.bin
```

...and now you can start the 'hashchecker' server with the file generated:
```
$ hashchecker -i sha256-ordered.bin
Loading SHA256 context...
Loading binary hashes from file /tmp/sha256-ordered.bin...
Server started at port 25800...
```
